Challenge 4 - Quiz Game

Vanilla Javascript project. 

Created a Quiz app with local storage functionality and saves recent scores and creates li for the highscores.  

Integrated CSS into this project and utilized background colors on CSS to show whether or not the answer was right or wrong.  When clicking on the correct answer, score goes up 1.  

Created an array of questions and called upon that array with functions for the game.
